# first-pop-up
skapa pop up modul där man kan klicka utanför rutan eller X för att lämna
This is my first attempt to read and understand more how to make a pop up modul with the help of HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
The only thing that was important for the assignment was to get it to be able to cancel the modul with clicking outside
of it or marked 'X'
